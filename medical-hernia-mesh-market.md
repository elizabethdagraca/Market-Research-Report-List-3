<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Hernia Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical hernia mesh is classified into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable mesh is designed to break down and be absorbed by the body over time, providing temporary support to the hernia repair. Non-absorbable mesh, on the other hand, remains in the body indefinitely, providing long-term reinforcement to the affected area. Both types have advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the patient's medical history, the size of the hernia, and the surgeon's preference.</p></p>
