<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In Vitro Toxicity Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dose Response</li><li>Threshold Response</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The In Vitro Toxicity market consists of two main types: Dose response and Threshold response. Dose response refers to the relationship between the dose of a substance and the effect it has on a biological system. This market focuses on studying how the toxicity of a substance changes with different doses. On the other hand, Threshold response focuses on identifying the minimum dose at which a substance starts to have a toxic effect. Both types of markets aim to understand the toxicity of substances and their effects on living organisms.</p></p>
