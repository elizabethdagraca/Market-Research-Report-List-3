<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fabric Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulse-Jet Cleaning</li><li>Shaking Cleaning</li><li>Reverse-Air Cleaning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fabric filters are commonly used in industries to remove particulate matter from gas streams. They are classified into three types based on the cleaning mechanism: pulse-jet cleaning, shaking cleaning, and reverse-air cleaning. Pulse-jet cleaning involves periodically releasing a burst of compressed air to dislodge the collected particles. Shaking cleaning uses mechanical vibration to remove the particles from the filter. Reverse-air cleaning involves reversing the flow of air to dislodge and remove the particles. Each type has its own advantages and is suited for different applications.</p></p>
