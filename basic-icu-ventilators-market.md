<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Basic ICU ventilators can be categorized into two main types: invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway to deliver oxygen directly into the lungs, while non-invasive ventilation delivers oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs without the need for intubation. Both types of ventilation are essential in managing respiratory failure and providing life-support in critical care settings. The choice between invasive and non-invasive ventilation depends on the patient's condition and individual needs.</p></p>
