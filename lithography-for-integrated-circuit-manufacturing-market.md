<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithography for Integrated Circuit Manufacturing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EUV Lithography</li><li>DUV Lithography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithography is a key process in integrated circuit manufacturing used to transfer design patterns onto silicon wafers. Two main types of lithography in the market are EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography and DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) lithography. EUV lithography uses shorter wavelengths for higher resolution and accuracy, making it ideal for advanced semiconductor nodes. DUV lithography, on the other hand, is used for older nodes and provides cost-effective solutions for less advanced processes. Both technologies play a crucial role in the production of integrated circuits.</p></p>
