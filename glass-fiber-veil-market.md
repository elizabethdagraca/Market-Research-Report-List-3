<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glass Fiber Veil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet-Laid Process</li><li>Dry-Laid Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glass fiber veil market is segmented based on the production process into Wet-Laid Process and Dry-Laid Process. In the Wet-Laid Process, glass fibers are dispersed in water, formed into a sheet, and dried to produce the veil. This method offers high uniformity and good quality. On the other hand, the Dry-Laid Process involves laying down individual glass fibers onto a conveyor belt and binding them together with a resin. This process is faster and more cost-effective but may result in lower quality veils.</p></p>
