<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jockey Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Turbine Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Jockey pumps are used in fire protection systems to maintain pressure in the system and prevent the main fire pump from starting unnecessarily. There are two main types of jockey pumps: centrifugal pumps and turbine pumps. Centrifugal pumps use kinetic energy to move fluid, while turbine pumps use the energy of a rotating impeller to move fluid. Both types are essential in maintaining adequate pressure in fire protection systems and ensuring the efficient operation of the system in case of a fire emergency.</p></p>
