<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Power Station Operator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-grid PV Power Station</li><li>Off Grid PV Power Station</li></ul></p>
<p><p>On-grid PV Power Station operators generate electricity from solar panels and feed it directly into the grid for distribution. They typically sell this electricity to utility companies for consumption by homes and businesses. Off-grid PV Power Station operators, on the other hand, generate electricity for localized consumption, often in remote areas without access to the main power grid. These operators may use batteries or other energy storage systems to store excess electricity for use when the sun is not shining.</p></p>
